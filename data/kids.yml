    - After the musical portion of our Sunday Service (10:30am), the children are dismissed to attend an interactive lesson about the bible in a way they can more easily understand. They also participate in a craft or other hands-on learning.
    - "If you plan on attending one of our Sunday morning Bible study classes (9:30am), your child may attend one of our children's classes."
    - For children three years old and and younger, we provide a warm, nurturing nursery for both the Sunday School hour and the corporate service.
