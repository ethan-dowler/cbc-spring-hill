Since the Scriptures are God-breathed, inspiration extends to the very words of the Bible so that the entire Bible, and only the Bible, is the Word of God. As such, the Bible is infallible and inerrant, our only rule of faith and practice <i>(II Tim. 3:16; II Pet. 1:21; Mat. 5:18; John 10:35; Rev. 22:18-19)</i>."

He arose from the tomb on the third day, ascended to the Father, and will return to earth one day as Judge and King <i>(John 1:1-3, 18; 5:22-23; 20:28; Rom. 9:5; Heb. 1:3, b, 8; 9:24; Phil 2:6-11; Col. 1:15-20; II Cor. 5:21; Mat. 25:31; Rev. 19:11-20:6; I John 2:2)</i>."

      title: Satan
      details:

    -
      title: Man
      details:
        - "We believe that man was created holy, but that when Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, sin entered into the world and has passed to all men. Thus, all men are sinners by nature and by choice and deserve eternal punishment in hell <i>(Gen. 1-3; Rom. 3:10-12, 23; 5:12; 8:7-8; Eph. 2:1-3; John 6:44; I John 4:19; Is. 64:6; Jer. 17:9)</i>."
    -
      title: Salvation

    -
      title: Regeneration
      details:
        - "When an individual responds in faith to the Gospel, turns to Christ for salvation, and repents of his sin, the Holy Spirit regenerates that person so that he is born again into God’s family <i>(John 3:3-7, 16; 1:12; II Cor. 5:17; Eph. 2:8-9; Rom. 3:22-28; I Pet. 1:23; Tit. 3:5; Acts 2:38, 17:30)</i>."
    -
      title: Justification
      details:
        - "This is the act of God whereby He declares the sinner to be righteous in His sight. On the basis of the work of Christ, God does not impute sin to the individual, imputing instead the righteousness of Christ <i>(Rom. 3:22-28; 4:1-8; 5:1-2; Gal. 2:16)</i>."
    -
      title: Sanctification
      details:
        - "Whereas regeneration is a one-time event in the life of the believer, sanctification is a continuing process by which God gradually transforms him into the image of Christ. This process will be completed when believers join Christ in heaven, perfected in holiness <i>(John 17:17; II Cor. 3:18; Eph. 5:26; I John 3:2; Acts 20:32)</i>."
    -
      title: Preservation
      details:
        - "Since salvation is based solely upon the grace of God and not on the merit of the individual, everyone who truly trusts in Christ as Savior is eternally secure in his salvation and is kept by God’s power. Scripture, however, gives a solemn warning to those who profess salvation but whose lives give no evidence of change because of the willful, continual practice of sin <i>(John 6:37, 39; 10:27-30; Rom. 8;38-39; I Pet 1;5; II Pet. 1:10; I John 3:7-10; James 2:14-26)</i>."
    -
      title: The Church
      details:
        - "We believe that the church, composed of all who have trusted Christ as Savior since Pentecost, is the body of Christ. Christ Himself is the Head of the Church. This spiritual organism is the universal aspect of the church <i>(Mat. 16:18; Eph. 1:22-23)</i>."
        - "The local church is an organized assembly of baptized believers, voluntarily associated in the faith for fellowship, worship, and service. Its mission is to spread the Gospel to all men and to edify the saints. The local church has the absolute right of self-government. As such, the local church should be free from the interference of any hierarchy of individuals or organizations, religious or governmental. Jesus Christ is the Head and Chief Shepherd <i>(Eph. 4:11-16)</i>."
        - "Christ instructed the church to observe two ordinances, both of which are symbolical rather than sacramental or efficacious."
    -
      title: Baptism
      details:
        - "All who profess faith in Jesus Christ should be baptized by immersion in water as a symbol of the death, burial, and resurrection of the Lord <i>(Mat. 28:19; Rom. 6:3-4)</i>. Baptism after salvation is an act of obedience and is a prerequisite for local church membership <i>(Matt. 28:18-20; Rom. 6:4; Acts 2:41; 8:12, 26-39)</i>."
    -
      title: "The Lord's Supper"
      details:

    -
      title: Last Things
      details:
        - "We believe in the imminent return of Jesus Christ, the rapture of the church, and the eternal punishment of unbelievers in hell and eternal blessings for believers in heaven <i>(I Thess. 4:13-18; Rev. 19:11-20:15, 21-22)</i>."
    -
      title: Biblical Complementary Design of Men and Women
      details:
        - "God has created men and women wonderfully different as complements, of equal value, and with differing functions for the good of all mankind. Qualified women who are gifted in leadership and teaching will have wonderful service opportunities at CBC in women's or children's ministries which function under the authority of our pastors."
        - "God created men and women different and complementary, and of equal value <i>(Gen. 2:7-25; 1 Cor. 11:1-16; Eph. 5:21-23; 1 Tim. 2:9-15; Gal. 3:23-29; 1 Pet. 3:1-6)</i>."
        - "This distinct and complementary design is seen fundamentally in the marriage relationship where the husband is called to sacrificial leadership as head of the home; as the wife is voluntarily called to follow her husband's leadership <i>(Gen. 2:7-25; 3:1-19; 1 Cor. 11:1-16; 14:34-35; Eph. 5:21-33; Col. 3:18-19; Titus 2:4-5; 1 Pet. 3:1-7)</i>"
        - "God's creative design is to be modeled also in the Church Body dynamic. Although equally gifted, women are not to be in a position of leadership, authority or teaching over men. This would apply to any gathering of God's people - worship celebration, small groups, or seminars <i>(Gen. 2:7-25; 3:1-19; 1 Tim. 2:11-15; 1 Cor. 11:1-16)</i>."
